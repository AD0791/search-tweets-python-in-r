# Running search-tweets-python in R
A code sample that walks you through how to run [Search Tweets Python](https://github.com/twitterdev/search-tweets-python) wrapper in R using the package [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). This code was created by [Jessica Garson](https://twitter.com/jessicagarson). For this code to run you will need to set up a configuration file with your secrets, a sample of this can be found under `secret.yaml`.

Be sure to add your `secrets.yaml` to your `.gitingore` and check out [our guide on securing keys and tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/securing-keys-and-tokens).
